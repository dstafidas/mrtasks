  <h1>How to Use the Kanban Board in Mr Tasks</h1>
  <p>A Kanban board is a powerful visual tool for organizing tasks and tracking progress. <a href="/">Mr Tasks</a> offers an intuitive, drag-and-drop Kanban board in its dashboard, making it easy to manage your projects efficiently. Whether you’re a freelancer, small business owner, or team leader, this guide will walk you through using the Kanban board to boost your productivity. ✅</p>

  <h2>What Is a Kanban Board?</h2>
  <p>A Kanban board organizes tasks into columns representing different stages of a workflow, typically “To Do,” “In Progress,” and “Completed.” By visualizing your tasks, you can prioritize work, identify bottlenecks, and stay focused. Mr Tasks’ Kanban board is designed for simplicity and flexibility, with features like color-coding and task details to enhance your workflow.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Adding Tasks to the “To Do” Column</h2>
  <p>Start by logging into Mr Tasks and navigating to the dashboard. Click the “Add Task” button to open a modal form. Fill in details like the task title, description, client (optional), deadline, and whether it’s billable. You can also assign a color (e.g., light red for urgent tasks) and set the initial status to “To Do.” Once saved, the task appears as a card in the “To Do” column.</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Moving Tasks with Drag-and-Drop</h2>
  <p>As you work on a task, simply drag its card from “To Do” to “In Progress.” When the task is finished, drag it to “Completed.” The drag-and-drop functionality, powered by the dragula library, is smooth and intuitive, even on mobile devices. You can also edit a task’s status directly by clicking the edit icon on the card, which opens a modal with all task details. 🚀</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Customizing Tasks for Clarity</h2>
  <p>Mr Tasks lets you customize tasks to suit your needs. Use the color swatch selector to assign colors for quick visual cues (e.g., light green for low-priority tasks). Add financial details like hourly rates and hours worked for billable tasks, which are useful for invoicing. The task card’s collapsible view shows a summary, while the expanded view displays full details like client, deadline, and total amount due.</p>

  <h2>Tips for Using the Kanban Board Effectively</h2>
  <p>- <strong>Keep Columns Balanced</strong>: Avoid overloading “In Progress” to prevent burnout.<br>
    - <strong>Use Deadlines</strong>: Set realistic deadlines and sort tasks by due date in the tasks page for a complementary view.<br>
    - <strong>Hide Completed Tasks</strong>: Use the hide feature to declutter the “Completed” column without deleting tasks.<br>
    - <strong>Review Regularly</strong>: Check your Kanban board daily to stay on track.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>The Kanban board in Mr Tasks is a game-changer for task management. Its drag-and-drop interface, customizable features, and responsive design make it easy to stay organized on any device. By following these steps, you can streamline your workflow and focus on what matters most—getting things done. ✅</p>
