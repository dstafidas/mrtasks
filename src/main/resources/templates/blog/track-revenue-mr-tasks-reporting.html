  <h1>How to Track Revenue with Mr Tasks’ Reporting</h1>
  <p>Understanding your business performance is key to growth, and tracking revenue is a critical part of that. <a href="/">Mr Tasks</a> offers powerful reporting tools to help you analyze tasks and revenue by month or client. This guide shows you how to use the reporting page to gain actionable insights. 📊</p>

  <h2>Why Track Revenue?</h2>
  <p>Tracking revenue helps you identify top clients, spot seasonal trends, and make informed decisions. Mr Tasks’ reporting page provides visual charts and filters to simplify analysis, saving you time and effort compared to manual spreadsheets.</p>

  <h2>Step 1: Select a Time Range</h2>
  <p>Navigate to the reporting page in Mr Tasks. Use the time range dropdown to choose a period, such as “Last Month,” “Last 6 Months,” or “Year to Date.” This filters the data displayed in the charts, focusing on the period you want to analyze. Selecting the right time range is key to uncovering meaningful trends. 💡</p>

  <h2>Step 2: Analyze Revenue by Month</h2>
  <p>The reporting page includes a line chart showing revenue over time. Each data point represents a month within your selected time range. Hover over points to see exact revenue figures and the number of billable tasks completed. This chart helps you identify peak months or dips in revenue, so you can plan accordingly.</p>

  <h2>Step 3: Break Down Revenue by Client</h2>
  <p>Below the monthly chart, a bar chart displays revenue by client. Filter by client or time range to see which clients contribute most to your income. For example, selecting “Last 6 Months” might show that Client A accounts for 40% of your revenue, prompting you to prioritize their projects.</p>

  <h2>Step 4: Use Insights to Optimize</h2>
  <p>Use the reporting insights to refine your strategy. For instance, if the monthly chart shows a revenue dip in Q3, consider increasing marketing efforts during that period. If the client chart highlights a high-value client, link more tasks to them in the dashboard to streamline invoicing. The reporting page’s responsive design lets you analyze data on any device.</p>

  <h2>Tips for Effective Revenue Tracking</h2>
  <p>- <strong>Mark Tasks as Billable</strong>: Ensure all revenue-generating tasks are marked as billable in the dashboard to reflect accurate data.<br>
    - <strong>Review Regularly</strong>: Check the reporting page monthly to stay on top of trends.<br>
    - <strong>Combine with Invoicing</strong>: Use revenue insights to generate targeted invoices for top clients.<br>
    - <strong>Export Data</strong>: Download charts as images to include in presentations or reports.</p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Mr Tasks’ reporting tools empower you to track revenue and tasks with ease, providing insights that drive growth. By selecting time ranges, analyzing charts, and applying data to your strategy, you can optimize your business performance. Best of all, it’s free and accessible on any device. ✅</p>
